This Lightning Web Component allows page visitors to
1. View a list of Accounts
2. Filter them by
  - Account Name (standard field) or Business Description (custom text field). The user types a string of characters into the search bar. The string is then matched to existing accounts' Name and Business Description values
  - County and Business Category (both custom picklists) using checkbox selections, where each checkbox corresponds to a picklist value
3. Check and uncheck all checkboxes at the same time using "Select All" and "Clear Selection" buttons
